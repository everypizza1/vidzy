Hello there! Welcome to the Vidzy repo, this project is a free and open source alternative to TikTok. The project has just started and is in very early stages.

If you want to test out this software for yourself, do checkout our little [documentation](docs/install.md).


## Features

As said, the project is in very early stages, and we will update the repo as soon as the code is available and tested. We will later add federation through [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).
